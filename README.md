# ArtrBackend

This is the backend for my final year project "Recommending Artworks With Using Machine Learning" 
as well as a jupiter notebook showing code and visualizations. 

## Description

The aim of this project is to investigate if it is possible to make interesting recommendations 
for paintings using only content based methods. The project explores using different types of 
recommender systems using convolutional neural networks and logistic regression.
